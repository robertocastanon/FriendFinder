# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is basically a dating app but for finding new friends!

This site takes in the users score from the survey and pulls up a potential new friend with similar answers.

## The Home Page.
This is a very simple page which is only intended to take you to the survey page. There is also a footer which goes to the API data of the friends list used and a link to the this github repo.

## The Survey Page.
This page has 2 input boxes, one where the user inputs thier name and the other is where the user inputs a url link of an image. Following this there are 10 survey questions and and option to choose from 1 through 5.

**1** meaning that you strongly disagree and **5** meaning that you strongly agree.

Then you submit it by pressing the Submit button and this will then evaluate your score with the 10 arrays and find the person with the least amount of differences. This person will pop up as a modal with their name and image.

The user's name, image and score will then be uploaded to the array.
